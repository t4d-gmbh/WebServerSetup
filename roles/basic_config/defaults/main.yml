# The 'swappiness' parameter configures how often the system swaps data out of RAM to disk.
# A value closer to 0 is generally recommended for servers to prioritize RAM usage [3-5].
swappiness_value: "10"

# The 'vfs_cache_pressure' setting configures how much the system caches inode and dentry information.
# A lower value (like 50) is recommended to prevent the system from removing inode information from cache too quickly [5-7].
