## Usage Examples
You find more complete usage examples under `examples/`.

### Initial Setup
This assumes a vanilla Ubuntu instance on which the user `ansible` will be set up and will get access with an SSH key that you must provide with the `public_key_path` argument.

The playbook could look as follows:
```yaml
# prepare.yml
---
- name: Initialize Ansible user
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    public_key: "{{ lookup('file', public_key_path) }}"
    new_ansible_user: ansible # Set your desired username here
  tasks:
    - name: Include the example role
      become: yes
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: t4d.WebServerSetup.init_ansible
```

To run it:
`ansible-playbook prepare.yml -e "public_key_path=/path/to/your/public_key.pub" -e "ansible_user=ubuntu" -e "ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/your/ssh/file" -e "public_key_path=/path/to/the/used/sshkey" -i your_inventory_file`

### Django Webapplication
It is recommended to run the Initial Setup before configuring the server.

#### Server configuration
This playbook will completely set up the Web application. For this to work you must:
*   Set the Ansible user and SSH key in *your_inventory_file*;
*   Have the following variables set in a local `vault.yml` file: `vault_db_password` (the password for the PostgreSQL database), `vault_infomaniak_DNS_key` (an Infomaniak token to perform DNS challenges), and `vault_repository_token` (an HTTP token that allows read access to your Django web app);
*   Have your Django application set up to use `python-decouple` and take the following variables from the `.env` file: `DATABASE_NAME`, `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `STATIC_ROOT`, `MEDIA_ROOT`.

The setup playbook can then look as follows:
```yaml
# setup.yml
---
- name: Configure Django Web App
  hosts: all # or target a specific host
  vars_files:
    - vault.yml # Include the vault file
  vars:
    app_name: myDjangoApp # Name of your Django application
    db_name: my_django_db # Name of the PostgreSQL database
    db_user: my_django_user # PostgreSQL user for the database
    # certbot & nginx specific setup
    server_name: myAwesomeSite.com # Your server's domain name or IP
    domain_name: myAwesomeSite.com # Domain name for the SSL certificate
    certbot_email: some@e.mail # Email for Certbot notifications
    # you likely don't want to change this
    cert_path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ domain_name | lower }}/fullchain.pem
    key_path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ domain_name | lower }}/privkey.pem
    # to get the web app
    git_remote: gitlab.com # or github.com or whatever
    git_repository_path: "<user>/<myapp>.git" # Git repository URL
    git_repository_branch: main # branch or tag
    # gunicorn setup
    gunicorn_workers: 3 # Number of Gunicorn workers
  roles:
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.basic_config # Added the basic_config role here
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.hardenServer
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.postgresqlSetup
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.certbot
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.nginxWebServer
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.installWebApp
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.celerySetup
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.gunicornSetup
```

To run it:
`ansible-playbook setup.yml --ask-vault-pass -i your_inventory_file`

#### Update Webapplication
This playbook assumes a fully configured web server on which it updates the Django application.
```yaml
---
- name: Update Django Web Application
  hosts: all # or target the specific host
  vars_files:
    - vault.yml # Include the vault file
  vars:
    app_name: myDjangoApp # Name of your Django application
    # to get the web app
    git_remote: gitlab.com # or github.com or whatever
    git_repository_path: "<user>/<myapp>.git" # Git repository URL
    git_repository_branch: main # branch or tag
  roles:
    - t4d.WebServerSetup.updateWebApp
```
